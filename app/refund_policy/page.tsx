   <p className="mb-4">Caring and professional counseling services are what we are striving to offer everyone. However, there are very rare occasions when a refund will be requested. This is our guide on refunds:</p>

   <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">One-on-One Sessions</h2>
   <p className="mb-4">A claim for reimbursement has to be made no later than within seven days after the date of the session.</p>
   <p className="mb-4">There would be a refund if sessions could not be conducted due to technical problems from our side or unavailability of counselors.</p>
   <p className="mb-4">Clients who fail to turn up for their sessions or need them rescheduled will be not granted refunds.</p>

   <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Subscription Plans</h2>
   <p className="mb-4">The unused part of pre-paid packages cannot be redeemed but can still be used during the active subscription period in the future.</p>
   <p className="mb-4">If a subscriber wants an early termination, he may get prorated refunds on any full months remaining subtracting one month’s subscription fee as an early termination charge which includes one month subscription amount.</p>
   <p className="mb-4">Custom or discounted subscription packages may only attract refunds according to the terms stated in them.</p>

   <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Refunds for Payments</h2>
   <p className="mb-4">Typically, refunds are credited back into the original payment method that was utilized. It might take 7-14 days for this process to happen.</p>
   <p className="mb-4">Any non-refundable payment provider or platform fees will not form part of the refund amounts given.</p>

   <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">General</h2>
   <p className="mb-4">Everyone is supposed to send back their refund requests before they are considered by emailing them through oursoulss.com@gmail.com.</p>
   <p className="mb-4">It is the prerogative of the site’s management to decide on eligibility for a refund depending on our policies listed here.</p>
   <p className="mb-4">We want you to know that all sales are final unless a refund is granted as per these terms and conditions when you use our services.</p>
   <p className="mb-4">We will make some exceptions in case there has been an event beyond your control but only if it makes sense and practical. Nonetheless, we are generally against refunds or chargebacks for consultancy services post delivery. Thank you for understanding. Reach out with any questions!</p>
